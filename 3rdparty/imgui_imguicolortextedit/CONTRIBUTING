# Contributing to ImGuiColorTextEdit

##Code of Conduct
ImGuiColorTextEdit has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project
participants to adhere to. Please read
[the full text](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand
what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Development Process
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Raising Issues
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/goossens/ImGuiColorTextEdit/issues)
to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/goossens/ImGuiColorTextEdit/issues/new);
it's that easy! Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce (be specific and give sample code if you can)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening,
	or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
